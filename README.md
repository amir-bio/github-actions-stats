## ðŸŒŸ Features


## How it works?

Long term: cache all fetched data and only retrieve again if not already cached.

## ðŸŒŸ Upcoming Features
- List all workflows
- List all runs for a workflow (up to last 100)
- Provide number of workflows that successed, and the ones that failed (future: more detailed explanation of failed, 
    e.g. cancelled vs failed; failed after how long?)
- Provide basic stats for the given runs for a workflow, e.g. min, max, mean, 80th, 90th, 95th, 99th percentile
- List all runs for a workflow with a variable time based start window
- Number of workflows run per day (with possibility of filtering by a given workflow)
- Filtering based on the branch that workflows ran on? 
- App to provide better UI/UX and allow for more sophisticated expansions and actions
